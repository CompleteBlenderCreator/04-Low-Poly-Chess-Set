## Managing A Larger Project
* Learn how to manage a larger project.
* Store your files for quick recall.
* This is just a suggested workflow.

##Planning Our Project
* Check out the design specs of a chess board.
* Design our chess board using that info.
* Decide on a working scale.
* Play about in Blender to get it feeling right.

## Making A Chess Board
* Start creating our chess board.
* Take over the cube object.
* Use the grid mesh to create the grid.

## Re-centring Your Objects
* How to centre your model in the view.
* Learn how to control an objects origin.

## Creating A Standard Asset
* Chose a style of chess set.
* Decide on construction method.
* Start creating our asset.

CONSTRUCTION METHOD

* Split our models into two components.
* Make a standard base asset that we can work from for all the other models.

## Using The Bevel Tool
* Box model the chess piece base.
* Using the bevel tool to round off our sharp edges.

## Appending or Duplicating
* Learn when you would duplicate an asset model.
* Choose when appending would be better.

Duplicating Vs Appending
* Appending picks out key parts of a blend file.
* Other Scene data would have to be appended separately.
* Duplicating would be exactly the same as the original file with everything intact.

## Bridging Edge Loops
* Learning the power of bridging edge loops.
* Opps our pawn is lovely but has too many polygons! 

## Where To Keep Materials In Blender
* Decide how we can manage our materials.
* Creating materials in one blend file.
* Each project will have a different way of handling materials depending on it’s size and scope.

MATERIALS IN OUR PROJECT
* 32 Pieces: Black & White
* Board: Black & White & Wooden Surround
* 5 Materials in the project.
* We’re going to assign materials in a Chess Scene Blend file.

## The 3D Cursor and Origin
* Take another look at our reference pieces.
* Look for commonality to save us time with modelling.
* Use the 3D Cursor and Origin to accurately control our piece.

## Selecting Hidden Geometry
* Learn how to select geometry that isn’t visible.
* Two straight forward ways,
* Switch view port shading to wireframe.
* Toggle ‘Limit selection to visible’.
* Build the rest of the Bishop.

## Boolean Modifier
* Experiment with a boolean modifier.
* Understand how to apply it to our model.
* Can been used constructively and destructively.
* It can work in edit mode.
* Real time and live!

## Introduction To Empties In Blender
* Introducing the concept of an empty.
* An empty is a null object, and has no geometry.
* They can be used as a handle to control objects.
* Used as a parent object for a group of objects.
* Many other uses.

Keeping It Lean

* Append the bishop into our chess scene.
* Check everything is right proportion wise.
* Start filling up our board, creating the white pawns.
* Link duplicate our bishop and pawns.
* Managing our models in this scene.

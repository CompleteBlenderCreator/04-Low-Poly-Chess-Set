# Section 4 - Low Poly Chess Set
****

Part of the Complete Blender Creator course on Udemy, see [here](https://www.udemy.com/blendertutorial/?couponCode=GitHubDiscount) for a special GitHub offer. The full course is part of [this](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bentristem/how-to-create-3d-assets-using-blender-online-cours) Kickstarter campaign which was 1000% funded.

These are just the files from the course, not the actual tutorial vidoes. At the time of writing this course has several hours of high-quality videos.

You're welcome to download, fork or do whatever else legal with all the files!

Enjoy yourselves.

## Managing A Larger Project
* Learn how to manage a larger project.
* Store your files for quick recall.
* This is just a suggested workflow.

## Planning Our Project
* Check out the design specs of a chess board.
* Design our chess board using that info.
* Decide on a working scale.
* Play about in Blender to get it feeling right.

## Making A Chess Board
* Start creating our chess board.
* Take over the cube object.
* Use the grid mesh to create the grid.

## Re-centring Your Objects
* How to centre your model in the view.
* Learn how to control an objects origin.

## Creating A Standard Asset
* Chose a style of chess set.
* Decide on construction method.
* Start creating our asset.

## Construction Method
* Split our models into two components.
* Make a standard base asset that we can work from for all the other models.

## Using The Bevel Tool
* Box model the chess piece base.
* Using the bevel tool to round off our sharp edges.

## Appending or Duplicating
* Learn when you would duplicate an asset model.
* Choose when appending would be better.

## Duplicating Vs Appending
* Appending picks out key parts of a blend file.
* Other Scene data would have to be appended separately.
* Duplicating would be exactly the same as the original file with everything intact.

## Bridging Edge Loops
* Learning the power of bridging edge loops.
* Opps our pawn is lovely but has too many polygons! 

## Where To Keep Materials In Blender
* Decide how we can manage our materials.
* Creating materials in one blend file.
* Each project will have a different way of handling materials depending on it’s size and scope.

## Materials in Our Project
* 32 Pieces: Black & White
* Board: Black & White & Wooden Surround
* 5 Materials in the project.
* We’re going to assign materials in a Chess Scene Blend file.

## The 3D Cursor and Origin
* Take another look at our reference pieces.
* Look for commonality to save us time with modelling.
* Use the 3D Cursor and Origin to accurately control our piece.

## Selecting Hidden Geometry
* Learn how to select geometry that isn’t visible.
* Two straight forward ways,
* Switch view port shading to wireframe.
* Toggle ‘Limit selection to visible’.
* Build the rest of the Bishop.

## Boolean Modifier
* Experiment with a boolean modifier.
* Understand how to apply it to our model.
* Can been used constructively and destructively.
* It can work in edit mode.
* Real time and live!

## Introduction To Empties In Blender
* Introducing the concept of an empty.
* An empty is a null object, and has no geometry.
* They can be used as a handle to control objects.
* Used as a parent object for a group of objects.
* Many other uses.

## Keeping It Lean
* Append the bishop into our chess scene.
* Check everything is right proportion wise.
* Start filling up our board, creating the white pawns.
* Link duplicate our bishop and pawns.
* Managing our models in this scene.

## Parent and Child Objects
* See how parents can group together objects, their children.
* Create a hierarchy which is easy to navigate.
* We’ll be using this to logically group our pieces.
* Parent>Child>Grand Child>Great Grand Child!

## Zoom To Mouse & Rotate Around Selection
* Great for working around more complex scenes.
* We’re changing the user preferences.
* Demonstrate both zoom to mouse and rotate around selection.
* Other view options available.

## View Options
* View>View Selected (NumberPad .)
* View Dolly: Ctrl + Shift + Middle-Mouse / Ctrl+ Shift + +/-.
* Walk/Fly Mode: Shift + F.

## Lighting in Blender Render
* Understand that lamps apply to Blender Render.
* Light is handled differently in Cycles.
* Adjusting lamps properties and seeing it’s affect.
* We will switch to rendered mode in the viewport shading options to see this effect.

## Hiding Un-Needed Objects.
* Discover it is useful when working on larger and more complex assemblies or scenes.
* Control whether you are hiding groups of objects as well as individuals.

## Defuse and Specular: Blender Render
* Need to understand these for getting rendering right.
* Looking at the two in isolation.
* Combining them to see the effect.
* Still using Blender Render.

## Diffuse and Specular Reflections
* Both are types of reflection.
* Diffuse is when Light scatters as it hits a surface.
* Specular is direct reflection of the light to the viewer.
* Materials are often a mix of the two.

## Using An Image As A Texture
* Show you how to add a texture to your material.
* Reinforce the defuse and specular settings.
* Model the board surround.
* Apply a texture to the board surround.

## Using Procedural Textures
* Introduce procedural textures.
* Apply some to the chequers on the board.

## Quads Vs Triangles… and Ngons
* Better overall to make models using quads.
* Explain what they are.
* Whatever you use- it is being converted back to triangles in the background.
* Watch out making things non planer…

## Non Planer Geometry
* Only happens with quads and NGons.
* Rendering & Exporting always converts geometry into triangles.- Lose control over the rendering.
* You cannot always see this in the 3D window.
* Makes a huge difference with flat models and flat shading.

### Triangles and nGons
* If your model comes to a point you might need a triangle.
* When sub dividing part of you model you are likely to create an NGon elsewhere.
* You will break loops when doing this.

### Solutions
*Good mesh topology from the beginning.
*Be lean and check your model through.
*Turn on mesh analysis (not 100%).
*Manually make face(s) Planar again. Normal, SZZ0.

## Edge Ring Select
* Learn about edge rings.
* How they help you manage your geometry.
* Definition: A series of edges which are not directly connected, but share faces.

## The Mirror Modifier
* How to setup and use the Mirror modifier.
* Start creating our Knight.

## The Edge Split Modifier (Update 28/10/16)
* Focus on creating a free form model.
* Ensuring faces are not triangulated when being created to keep with our style.
* Introduce the edge split modifier.
* This is the basis of organic modelling.

## Setting Up A Camera For Rendering
* Learn about camera placement.
* They're a directional object.
* Overview of the camera settings.
* You can have more than one camera, but only one active camera.

## CS33 Exporting Your Model
* Tidy our folders for future access.
* Export your model(s) as an FBX.
* Import .FBX into Unreal and Unity game engines.
* Opening Blender models in Unity 5.
* About exporting textures and materials.
